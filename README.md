##THIS IS A REPO CONTAINING PYTHON DATA ANALYSIS METHODS LIKE NUMPY FUNCTIONS AND PANDAS METHODS WITH DATAFRAMES##

# My-Top-5-numpy-functions
These 5 functions are a brief search of mine, on the most useful functions to make useful calculations or other analysis . As an electrical engineering student I found the use of these functions quite necessary.
Python has been recently developing the way data analysis works and the numpy library especially has been covering many ways of calculating important data properties. This is a quick 
5 numpy functions you can use to make your life eiasier using them to analysis a signal, make better conclusions about your data and and manipulate equations easily and fast!
These functions are a proof of the great use of numpy library in data analysis!
